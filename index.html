        <h2>Why Savory food is better than Sweet food</h2>
        <h3>Jenifer's Argument</h3>

        <p>Savory is the best flavor because a large majority of fried and grilled food is savory.</p>

        <p>Salt is a universal food seasoning, as it is accepted by all tastes.</p>

        <p>Sweet food can get nauseating easily. This is not an issue with most savory foods.</p>

        <p>Because savory food doesn't usually get nauseating, people are able to enjoy it in larger quantities.</p>

        <p>Savory food is healthier than sweet food because people use less salt than sugar.</p>
